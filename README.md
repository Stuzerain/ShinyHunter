## Summary ##
  <!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
  ShinyHunter allows users to quickly and easily keep track of which Pokemon they are shiny hunting, their odds of encountering shiny pokemon, and what those shiny pokemon look like (because let's be honest, some shinies are not worth hunting!). ShinyHunter is also an easy way to know shiny Pokemon you have already contained, so you can show off a big, impressive list to friends using a ShinyHunters Friend List that keeps a user up to date on what their friends are hunting.

## Problem ##
  <!-- > Describe the problem your product solves. -->
  Hunting for shiny Pokemon is agonizing. It's extremely repetitive. But the end result is a rare Pokemon that you're proud of because of its rarity, but also because of the circumstances leading up to the payoff. Sometimes we brag about the thrill of getting a shiny in significantly less time than we expected, but for a real shiny hunter, knowing that you got extremely unlucky and went through hundreds of Pokemon before the big payoff is like a badge of honor.

## Solution ##
  <!-- > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
  ShinyHunter helps users track the time spent hunting and maintain their sanity by proving just how lucky or unlucky they've been with a probability calculator. It also provides an easy way to track friends and their goals.

## Message ##
  <!-- > A quote from a spokesperson in your company. -->
  ShinyHunter was conceived in a moment of frustration. I was telling a friend about a particularly grueling time hatching eggs and I wanted to tell him about how many eggs I hatched and how long I spent running around in circles doing this. Unfortunately, I wasn't keeping track of how many eggs I hatched, so he thought I was just exaggerating when I said I must've hatched at least 2000 eggs. So, I set out to create an app that kept track of these arduous shiny hunts for me and both proved and preserved just how unlucky I was in a way I could share with friends.


## How to Get Started ##
  <!-- > Describe how easy it is to get started. -->
  Using ShinyHunter is as easy as searching for a Pokemon by name to add it to your list. From there, you will get to compare its regular and shiny sprites. You can mark a pokemon as caught, or you can delete it from your list if you decide the shiny isn't as attractive as you thought. As you're hunting, you can keep track of how many encounters or eggs it's taking you to obtain, and ShinyHunter will automatically compare your outcome with the expected probability. When you finally do get that shiny Pokemon, you can mark it as 'caught' and it will be added to a persistent collection, along with how long it took to obtain.
