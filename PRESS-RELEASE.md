There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Summary ##
  <!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
  ShinyHunter allows users to quickly and easily keep track of which Pokemon they are shiny hunting, their odds of encountering shiny pokemon, and what those shiny pokemon look like (because let's be honest, some shinies are not worth hunting!). ShinyHunter is also an easy way to know shiny Pokemon you have already contained, so you can show off a big, impressive list to friends using a ShinyHunters Friend List that keeps a user up to date on what their friends are hunting.

## Problem ##
  <!-- > Describe the problem your product solves. -->
  Hunting for shiny Pokemon is agonizing. It's extremely repetitive. But the end result is a rare Pokemon that you're proud of because of its rarity, but also because of the circumstances leading up to the payoff. Sometimes we brag about the thrill of getting a shiny in significantly less time than we expected, but for a real shiny hunter, knowing that you got extremely unlucky and went through hundreds of Pokemon before the big payoff is like a badge of honor.

## Solution ##
  <!-- > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
  ShinyHunter helps users track the time spent hunting and maintain their sanity by proving just how lucky or unlucky they've been with a probability calculator. It also provides an easy way to track friends and their goals.

## Message from SH, creator of ShinyHunter ##
  <!-- > A quote from a spokesperson in your company. -->
  ShinyHunter was conceived in a moment of frustration. I was telling a friend about a particularly grueling time hatching eggs and I wanted to tell him about how many eggs I hatched and how long I spent running around in circles doing this. Unfortunately, I wasn't keeping track of how many eggs I hatched, so he thought I was just exaggerating when I said I must've hatched at least 2000 eggs. So, I set out to create an app that kept track of these arduous shiny hunts for me and both proved and preserved just how unlucky I was in a way I could share with friends.


## How to Get Started ##
  <!-- > Describe how easy it is to get started. -->
  Using ShinyHunter is as easy as searching for a Pokemon by name to add it to your list. From there, you will get to compare its regular and shiny sprites. You can mark a pokemon as caught, or you can delete it from your list if you decide the shiny isn't as attractive as you thought. As you're hunting, you can keep track of how many encounters or eggs it's taking you to obtain, and ShinyHunter will automatically compare your outcome with the expected probability. When you finally do get that shiny Pokemon, you can mark it as 'caught' and it will be added to a persistent collection, along with how long it took to obtain.

## Customer Quote ##
  <!-- > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit. -->
  While ShinyHunter isn't able to save me any time in-game, it does the things that I was already doing in my head for me, and it does them well. Never again will I forget what number encounter or egg I'm on or have a friend doubt that I got a shiny after only 6 or 7 eggs. ShinyHunter is easy to use and I recommend it to all the shiny hunters out there!
